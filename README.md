# ssh-bastion
An ssh-bastion pod to make access to openshift clusters easy

1. Make sure that `oc` is configured to talk to the cluster
1. Run: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eparis/ssh-bastion/master/deploy/deploy.sh | bash`
1. ssh as core to/through the bastion.
1. The bastion address can be found by running `oc get service -n ssh-bastion ssh-bastion -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'`

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eparis/ssh-bastion/master/ssh.sh provides a simple script to automate sshing through to bastion to nodes in the cluster.
